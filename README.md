# Pinterest Project
This was a group project done by Mathew Ostrander, Michael Conrad, and Jacob Paine

We were tasked with recreating Pinterest and only given a couple of days to get as far as we could.
We attempted to do a parody version PAINterest, based on supervillians.

The first steps we took were planning and figuring out what our minimum viable product was, we worked on authentication, and we created a basic mockup.
Once we got basic functionality going using JavaScript then we started to worry about the particular styling.

We managed to recreate some of the basic funcionality, but ultimately ran out of time before we had to submit it.

Firebase was used to store our data.

Next steps would be to flatten out our database structure, expand search funcionality, and allow for creation of more boards.
